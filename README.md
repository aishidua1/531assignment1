# 531 Assignment 1
## Scenario:
A common physical object is a golf glove. This was one of the items on the table in class which no one chose to do. As a golfer, I had an idea about how the glove could be enhanced to help golfers track their stats. According to Gemini, a golf glove is mainly used for four things: enhanced grip, blister prevention, moisture control, and reduced grip tension. While the classic golf glove has been used for many years, there are still some gaps with the design. 
The gaps that I am addressing are the awareness gap, feedback gap, and social fit gap. These gaps feel the most important because of the opportunity for advancement that they have. Since a golf glove has been well developed for many years, I feel that there are not too many changes that can be implemented. Still, when thinking of technical advancements that can be done, those three gaps fit the best. The glove is the best place for the opportunities that I have listed below because of the minimal change that would be required. Along with this, the glove is a good place to get accurate measurements for the golfer and how they can improve their swing in the future. The adaptation and anticipation gaps feel far from what new advancements in a golf glove can achieve. 
## Gaps / Opportunities: 
The golf glove is typically white and made of leather, which gets dirty quite easily and gets ripped easily as well because of the stretching and usage. An opportunity with the design of the glove could be for a dark side and a light side. Having the lighter side on the outside of the glove will reduce the friction and darkening of the glove without absorbing heat, while the darker side (in the palm) would have a cleaner appearance. Along with this, a change in the material of the glove could help maintain the structure better. According to Gemini, a good reinforcement strategy would be to use Kevlar stitching on the dark side of the palm and keeping the soft Cabretta leather on the outside for flexibility. This slight change would help with the structural integrity of the glove, making it last longer for golfers. 

The glove is nice for grip, but doesn’t give you any feedback on your swing or the position of your hand before your swing. There is a big opportunity with this and the advancement of technology since there could be different kinds of trackers to analyze the speed of a swing or the placement of your hands on the golf club. The kind of technology that could be embedded into this is by using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which could track the swing tempo and wrist angle, recommended by Gemini. Along with this, predictive ML could be integrated so that there is clarity between a practice swing and real swing. Threshold-based logic would not work because that might trigger every time the golfer moves their arms, causing inaccurate tracking. Solving for this gap would benefit the golfer, since these insights could help better their game overall. 

With the social gap, it is quite common to use a golf glove on the course, but golfers typically take them off on the green when putting. That can be a nuisance to remove and re-velcro on every green for all 9-18 holes. A simple way that this could be enhanced is by removing the velcro and adding a hook that is easy to clip on and readjust when being used. This can be tested to make sure that when a golfer is maybe walking to another hole and putting their glove back on, their time is not wasted. A back up solution to that would be high-quality magnets, but there would need to be a consideration of the sizing when considering that solution. 

Overall, when thinking of social considerations, there are a couple of things that come to mind. Firstly, the idea of getting rid of a habit and understanding a new behavior. Many golfers naturally take their glove off on the putting green which is an automatic sound that signals people’s moves. The slight change in color of the glove is minimal and would not have a negative social impact. The swing tracker that would be embedded into the glove would also be a small tracker that could potentially be just a sensor that connects with the golfer’s phone. It would not be something bulky, but more of something that is trendy and minimal. 

When thinking of the tradeoffs, there are some considerations that must be addressed. For example, the magnet that replaces the velcro may unintentionally get caught in the golfer’s clubs or bag. Along with this, the price of the glove would increase because of the advancement in tech. It changes from a “disposable” glove to something that is more durable and reusable. Another consideration is that many golfers like to switch out their gloves for hygiene purposes. To accommodate that, there is the potential of making the sensor easily switchable from each glove. Lastly, a slight impact that may need some time for the golfer to get used to is the fact that there may be slightly more weight on the back of their hand because of the sensor. Overall, while some of the changes are minimal there are some considerations that need to be made for a successful, advanced, and well-developed golf glove.
